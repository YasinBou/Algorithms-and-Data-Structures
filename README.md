# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
I made this repository to practise Algorithms and Data Structures. 
Unit tests will be written for certain implementations and algorithms.

### Goals (Adding more later)
* Create helper methods for multidimensional arrays with proper error handling [✔]
* Implement an ArrayList that is iterable and takes advantage of generics [✔]
* Implement Doubly Linked List [ ]
